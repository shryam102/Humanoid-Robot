# Humanoid Robot Prototyping
This project involves building a humanoid robot with a movable head, two-plane hand movements, and the ability to perform basic movements such as forward, backward, left, and right. The robot is controlled using an Arduino Uno and a wireless remote. The wireless connection is established using RF modules (nRF24L01).
