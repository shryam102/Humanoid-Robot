# Humanoid Robot Prototyping
This project involves building a humanoid robot with a movable head, two-plane hand movements, and the ability to perform basic movements such as forward, backward, left, and right. The robot is controlled using an Arduino Uno and a wireless remote. The wireless connection is established using RF modules (nRF24L01).

## Features
* **Movable Head:** The humanoid robot is equipped with a servo motor for head movement, adding a dynamic element to its interactions.
* **Two-Plane Hand Movements:** The robot's hands are designed for movements in two planes, providing flexibility and enhancing its range of motion.
* **Overall Movement:** The robot can perform basic movements such as forward, backward, left, and right, thanks to the inclusion of four DC motors.
* **Wireless Remote Control:** Use the wireless remote to control the robot's actions from a distance, providing convenience and ease of use.
* **Arduino Uno Control:** The robot's movements and functionalities are powered by an Arduino Uno, making it easily programmable and customizable.
